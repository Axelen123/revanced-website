# Writing documentation

You can write documentation with markdown or asciidoc.

## Title
The first line must be the `h1` equivalent of the markup language.
For markdown, this would be `# <title>` and `= <title>` for asciidoc.

**The title part may or may not go through the markup processor depending on the language.** It is instead added by the website itself.
